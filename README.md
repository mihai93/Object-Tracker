# Object-Tracker
Frame-by-frame processing using MATLAB to track objects for MTE 204 FEM project

This analysis was done to confirm mathematical models by experimental method:
- Coloured nodes were filmed
- Video was analyzed frame-by-frame to detect node (x, y) positions
- Node positions were plotted in various test scenarios to compare with mathematical models

## Post-processed image example
This is what tracking looks like, frame-by-frame:
